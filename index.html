This is a scalable solution that can be hosted on a on-premises data center or on a public cloud,with its servers, storage etc. completely managed and controlled by your IT team in accordance with a company’s governance and security requirements.</p>


<h3>Building an Automated Business Process using Managed Services on a Public Cloud</h3>
<p>It is imperative that the organizations be interlinked with the customers and vendors. This process has been very sluggish, manual, batch-based and prone to failures. Such Integration design has led to impaired decision making and delays in the detection of fraudulent actions. This project created an automated, event-based real-time process using managed cloud services that do not have these limitations.</p>


<h3>Building a serverless web application using manages cloud services</h3>
<p>Build a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. The application will present users with an HTML-based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interface on the backend with a RESTful web service to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.</p>

<h3>Team Communication Solution</h3>

This is a scalable solution that can be hosted on a on-premises data center or on a public cloud,with its servers, storage etc. completely managed and controlled by your IT team in accordance with a company’s governance and security requirements.</p>


<h3>Building scalable and resilient applications</h3>
<p>Creating web applications that are both resilient and scalable is an essential part of any application architecture. A well-designed application should scale seamlessly as demand increases and decreases and be resilient enough to withstand the loss of one or more compute resources.</p>


<h3>Create Manage a Nonrelational Database using AWS DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, allowing for flexible schema design that can evolve with your application. It provides low-latency performance with near-infinite scaling, so you do not need to worry about performance bottlenecks as your application grows. Create DynamoDB tables with required secondary keys and perform CRUD operations. Use Python and Boto 3, AWS SDK for Python, for interacting with the DynamoDB APIs</p>


<h3>Deploying web app using ECS</h3>
<p>small and large enterprises have invested heavily in developing bespoke applications. Since these applications have been built and enhanced over a period of time, they are complex and any form of re-engineering to convert it to smaller, modular and independently hosted services is difficult. Managed Container Services from cloud providers allows predictable and reproducible packaging of such apps. This project moved & deployed a classical web app to AWS ECS containers.</p>
